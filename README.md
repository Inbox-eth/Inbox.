# Inbox xmtp.chat app

xmpt v3 inbox built with privy & ens registartion

The app is built using the [XMTP client browser SDK](https://github.com/xmtp/xmtp-js/tree/main/sdks/browser-sdk)



### Limitations

At the moment it has all the limitations of xmtp.chat: This React app isn't a complete solution. For example, the list of conversations doesn't update when new messages arrive in existing conversations.


## Roadmap
- [x] Wallet onboarding (Privy)
- [x] ENS subname registration (NameStone)
- [x] Messaging and inbox (XMTP V3)
- [ ] Notification system
- [ ] Documentation and coverage


## Bugs

Currently there is an issue with syncing conversations. Working on it.
