# Inbox xmtp.chat app

xmpt v3 inbox built with privy & ens registartion

The app is built using the [XMTP client browser SDK](/sdks/browser-sdk/README.md)



### Limitations

At the moment it has all the limitations of xmtp.chat: This React app isn't a complete solution. For example, the list of conversations doesn't update when new messages arrive in existing conversations.
